# K-Means Clustering with Data Preprocessing

This project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering on a dataset with full data preprocessing. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and then applying the K-Means clustering algorithm to group data into clusters.

## Overview

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters. In this project, the dataset goes through several preprocessing steps to ensure the data is clean and ready for clustering. Afterward, the K-Means algorithm is applied to the dataset, and the results are analyzed.

## Project Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Applies the K-Means algorithm to partition the data into clusters.
- **Visualization:** Displays a plot showing the clusters and their centroids (if the dataset is 2D or reduced to 2D).

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualizing the clusters)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### How to Run
- Prepare Your Dataset: Make sure you have your dataset ready. It can be in CSV or any other format supported by Pandas.

- Preprocess the Data: The script automatically handles missing values, categorical data encoding, and feature scaling.

- Run the K-Means Clustering: The code applies the K-Means algorithm, and you can specify the number of clusters.

- View the Results: If the dataset is 2D or reduced to 2D, a scatter plot will show the clusters with their centroids.

### Project Structure 

- kmeans_clustering.py  # Python script that performs K-Means clustering with preprocessing
- README.so             # This readme file
- dataset.csv           # Example dataset (replace with your own dataset)

### Conclusion
This project allows you to perform K-Means clustering on your data after preprocessing, which is a crucial step to ensure good results. The K-Means algorithm is a powerful tool for unsupervised learning tasks like customer segmentation or anomaly detection.
